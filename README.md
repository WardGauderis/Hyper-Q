# Ultra-Q: Extending Hyper-Q Learning for Adaptive Multi-Agent Games

This work presents *Ultra-Q Learning*, a variant of Q-Learning adapted for efficient solving of multi-agent games with independent learning agents. Ultra-Q Learning is an extension of the *Hyper-Q Learning* algorithm proposed Tesauro ([2003](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2003/file/e71e5cd119bbc5797164fb0cd7fd94a4-Paper.pdf)) that is more efficient for solving adaptive multi-agent games.
